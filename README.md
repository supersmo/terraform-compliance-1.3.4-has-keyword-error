Refreshing Terraform state in-memory prior to plan...
The refreshed state will be used to calculate this plan, but will not be
persisted to local or remote state storage.


------------------------------------------------------------------------

An execution plan has been generated and is shown below.
Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # google_storage_bucket.example-bucket will be created
  + resource "google_storage_bucket" "example-bucket" {
      + bucket_policy_only          = (known after apply)
      + force_destroy               = false
      + id                          = (known after apply)
      + location                    = "EUR4"
      + name                        = (known after apply)
      + project                     = "xxx"
      + self_link                   = (known after apply)
      + storage_class               = "STANDARD"
      + uniform_bucket_level_access = (known after apply)
      + url                         = (known after apply)
    }

  # random_id.random will be created
  + resource "random_id" "random" {
      + b64         = (known after apply)
      + b64_std     = (known after apply)
      + b64_url     = (known after apply)
      + byte_length = 4
      + dec         = (known after apply)
      + hex         = (known after apply)
      + id          = (known after apply)
    }

Plan: 2 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.

          Given I have a resource defined that supports location
          When it has location
                  Failure: location property in google_storage_bucket.example-bucket resource does not match with ^eur(4|3)$|^europe-(north1|west(1|3|4))$ case insensitive regex. It is set to None.
                  Failure: location property in google_storage_bucket.example-bucket resource does not match with ^eur(4|3)$|^europe-(north1|west(1|3|4))$ case insensitive regex. It is set to False.
                  Failure: location property in google_storage_bucket.example-bucket resource does not match with ^eur(4|3)$|^europe-(north1|west(1|3|4))$ case insensitive regex. It is set to None.
                  Failure: location property in google_storage_bucket.example-bucket resource does not match with ^eur(4|3)$|^europe-(north1|west(1|3|4))$ case insensitive regex. It is set to *****.
                  Failure: location property in google_storage_bucket.example-bucket resource does not match with ^eur(4|3)$|^europe-(north1|west(1|3|4))$ case insensitive regex. It is set to None.

          Then its value must match the "^eur(4|3)$|^europe-(north1|west(1|3|4))$" regex
